      <ul>
        <li>
          Models a parametric open web steel joist with back-to-back angle
          chords. SLOW

        <li>
          Creates a building roof structure with 250 open web steel joists
          arranged in 5 bays of 50 joists each, spaced 8 feet apart. SLOW

          Creates a building roof structure with 1000 open web steel joists
          arranged in 10 bays of 100 joists each, spaced 8 feet apart. SLOW

      <ul>
        <li>
          Creates a multi-story building structure with 5000 open web steel
          joists arranged in 5 floors of 10 bays with 100 joists each. Story
          height: 32 feet. Same joist copied, so not realistic

        >
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creates the same multi-story building, but treats each joist as unique
          to test performance. TAKES LIKE 15 MINUTES SO I DON'T RECOMMEND IT
          CLICKING THIS LINK. TRY THE ONE BELOW INSTEAD.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Creates the same multi-story building, but uses a faster algorithm for
          rendering. Simulates 5000 joists with 1000 unique marks.
        </li>
        <li>
          OpenCascade is doing the geometric modeling and tessellation. Three.js
          handles all the rendering. The speed comes from doing the expensive
          OpenCascade work once upfront, then using fast GPU rendering for the
          5000 instances.
        </li>
        <li>
          This simulates an architecture where OpenCascade does the heavy
          geometric lifting during library creation, but runtime instantiation
          is just fast data lookups and GPU rendering.
        </li>
        <li>
          The idea would be we represent our models using a library of 
          predefined shapes and objects that are parameterized.
          Any tool could then pluck what component they need from the library
          and instantiate it quickly, without needing to do the heavy OpenCascade
          work again. Extending it or new demands is easy to handle.

          <strong>THE ULTIMATE STRESS TEST:</strong> Creates a massive 10-story
          building with <strong>10,000 open web steel joists</strong> using 10000
          unique marks from a pre-tessellated library.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Building specs:</strong> 10 floors Ã— 10 bays Ã— 100 joists per
          bay = 10,000 total joists. Building height: 320 feet. Uses the same
          fast library-based approach but scaled up 2x.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Library approach:</strong> 10000 pre-tessellated joist variants
          with expanded specifications (35-84 ft lengths, 24-46" depths, 75 web
          patterns, multiple steel grades). Simulates a comprehensive structural
          engineering library.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance target:</strong> Lightning-fast instantiation
          regardless of complexity. Tests the absolute limits of the
          library-based approach with realistic building scale.
